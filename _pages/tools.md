**Hardware:** [iMac 27"](http://apple.de), [MacBook Pro 15"](http://), notepad.

**Text editors:** I use [RubyMine]() for Rails development and awesome [Atom]() for almost everything else (this text is written in Atom).

**Project and time management:** [Trello]() for all my Kanban boards, [ProductBoard]() to keep track of features and ideas and [OmniFocus]() to organize my life.

**Notes**: [Dropbox Paper]() to grasp and brainstorm ideas quickly, [Alternote]() to keep everything important by hand (?) and [SnippetsLab]() to store reusable code snippets and configs.

**Communication:** [Slack]() is the center of all my work-related communication, [Telegram]() is for staying in touch with family and friends,

**Development environments:** [Vagrant]()

**Version control:** [Git]() is my favourite version control system and all my code is hosted on [Github]().
