## My work setup
---

![my workspace](/img/workspace.jpg)

**Hardware:** [iMac 27"](http://www.apple.com/imac/), [MacBook Pro 15"](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), notepad.

**Text editors:** I use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Rails development and awesome [Atom](https://atom.io/) for almost everything else (this text is written in Atom).

**Project and life management:** [Trello](https://trello.com) has all my Kanban boards, features, ideas and user feedback.
Also I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) to organize my life in general.

**Notes**: [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) is to grasp and brainstorm ideas quickly, [Alternote](http://alternoteapp.com/) to keep everything important at hand and [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) to store reusable code snippets and configs.

**Communication and collaboration:** [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the center of all my work-related communication, [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is for staying in touch with family and friends.

**Development environments:**  I use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in order to keep my development environments (provisioned by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) in sync.

**Operations:** All my projects are built as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images and deployed to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) servers with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) scripts.
[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is used as the file storage.

**Version control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is my favorite version control system and all my code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/altmer).

**Mockups:** I do my mockups in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and I use [Lingo](https://www.lingoapp.com/) to store my visual assets.
