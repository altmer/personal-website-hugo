## My work setup
---

![my workspace](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**Hardware:** [iMac 27"](http://www.apple.com/imac/), [MacBook Pro 15"](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), notepad.

**Text editors:** I use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Rails development and awesome [Atom](https://atom.io/) for almost everything else (this text is written in Atom).

**Project and time management:** [Trello](https://trello.com) has all my Kanban boards, [ProductBoard](https://productboard.com) to keep track of features and ideas and [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) to organize my life.

**Notes**: [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) to grasp and brainstorm ideas quickly, [Alternote](http://alternoteapp.com/) to keep everything important at hand and [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) to store reusable code snippets and configs.

**Communication and collaboration:** [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the center of all my work-related communication, [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is for staying in touch with family and friends. [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/
) is a great tool to share mockups and sketches.

**Development environments:**  I use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in order to keep my development environments (provisioned by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)) in sync.

**Clouds:** All my projects are happily hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) servers. I use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) as a storage for file uploads. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is great for hosting prototypes.

**Version control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is my favourite version control system and all my code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/altmer).

**Mockups:** I do my mockups in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and I use [Lingo](https://www.lingoapp.com/) to store and search my visual assets.
