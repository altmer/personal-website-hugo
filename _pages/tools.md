**Hardware:** [iMac 27"](http://apple.de), [MacBook Pro 15"](http://), notepad.

**Text editors:** I use [RubyMine]() for rails development and [Atom]() for almost everything else (this text is written in Atom).

**Project and time management:** [Trello]() for all my Kanban boards, [ProductBoard]() to keep track of features and ideas, [Dropbox Paper]() to grasp and brainstorm ideas quickly and [OmniFocus]() to organize my life.

**Version control:** [Git]() is my favourite version control system and all my code is hosted on [Github]().
