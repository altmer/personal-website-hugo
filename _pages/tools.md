## My work setup
---

![my workspace](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**Hardware:** [iMac 27"](http://www.apple.com/imac/), [MacBook Pro 15"](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), notepad.

**Text editors:** I use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Rails development and awesome [Atom](https://atom.io/) for almost everything else (this text is written in Atom).

**Project and time management:** [Trello](https://trello.com) for all my Kanban boards, [ProductBoard](https://productboard.com) to keep track of features and ideas and [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) to organize my life.

**Notes**: [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) to grasp and brainstorm ideas quickly, [Alternote]() to keep everything important by hand (?) and [SnippetsLab]() to store reusable code snippets and configs.

**Communication and collaboration:** [Slack]() is the center of all my work-related communication, [Telegram]() is for staying in touch with family and friends. [Invision]() is a great tool to share mockups and sketches.

**Development environments:** [Vagrant]()

**Cloud services:** All my projects are happily hosted on [Digital Ocean]() servers. I use [AWS]() as a storage for file uploads. [Heroku]() is great for hosting prototypes.

**Version control:** [Git]() is my favourite version control system and all my code is hosted on [Github]().
