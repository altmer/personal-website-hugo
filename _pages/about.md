## I'm a software developer
---

_Living in Berlin, Germany_

My biggest passion in life is to create great products for real people (and for fun of course).
I started doing programming in my university's [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) team. The first years of my
professional career went in [a large consulting company](http://at-consulting.co.uk/) in Moscow, Russian Federation.
In this company I was doing Java (and later Ruby) development in enterprise-scale projects.
To take a next step of my life and career, I moved to Berlin and joined [startup](http://finreach.de) in Fintech area.
Later I moved on to a bigger company that [digitalizes steel industry](https://www.kloeckner-i.com/).

I like exploring and learning something new. [Traveling](http://hamster.travel/en/users/191#/map) is my second passion in life. That's why my biggest side project is a [travel planning app](http://hamster.travel) for me and my friends (and hopefully for other travellers in the future). I am trying to spend some time every day developing side projects to learn, to expand my horizons and to create something cool.

**Elixir/Phoenix** is the main technology in my stack now. Functional programming ideally fits my style and helps to create
beautiful and maintainable code. **Ruby on Rails** though is still one of my favourite tools and the one I am most comfortable with.

Currently I am learning **Clojure** in order to deepen my skills in functional programming.

My default database of choice is **Postgresql**, but I have also used **MongoDB** and **Redis** in many projects.

**React** is my frontend library of choice; I also used **Angularjs** before.
Also I have experience with using **Elasticsearch** to power search on large dataset (hundreds of millions of records).

I can freely communicate in **English** and **Russian** and learning **German**.

At the moment I am:

* working at [Kloeckner.i](https://www.kloeckner-i.com/) and making banking services better;

* developing side projects: [Hamster Travel](http://hamster.travel), [Hamster's Backpack](http://hamsters-backpack.com/en), [Skaro](https://skgm.es/) and others to be announced;

* learning Clojure;

* travelling as much as possible.
