## I'm a software developer
---

_Living in Berlin, Germany_

My biggest passion in life is to create great products for real people (and for fun of course).
I started doing programming in my university's [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) team. The first years of my
professional career went in [a large consulting company](http://at-consulting.co.uk/) in Moscow, Russian Federation.
In this company I was doing Java (and later Ruby) development in enterprise-scale projects.
To take a next step of my life and career, I moved to Berlin and joined [startup](http://finreach.de) in Fintech area.

I like exploring and learning something new. [Travelling](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/members/altmer) is my second passion in life. That's why my biggest side project is a [travel planning app](http://hamster.travel) for me and my friends (and hopefully for other travellers in the future). I am trying to spend some time every day developing side projects to learn, to expand my horizons and to create something cool.

**Ruby on Rails** is the main technology in my stack for some time already. Also I am learning **Elixir**/**Phoenix** stack
and consider using it for my new projects.
Though I don't actively develop in **Java** at the moment, I have some experience with it and can create microservices with **Spring**. My default database of choice is **Postgresql**, but I have also used **MongoDB** and **Redis** in many projects.
I use **Angular** as a full-featured frontend JS framework and **React** in smaller projects.
Also I have experience with using **Elasticsearch** to power search on large dataset (hundreds of millions of records).
**Meteor** js framework is extremely useful for creating small realtime web applications.

I can freely communicate in **English** and **Russian** and learning **German**.

At the moment I am:

* working at [FinReach](http://finreach.de) and making banking services better;

* developing side projects: [Hamster Travel](http://hamster.travel), [Hamster's Backpack](http://hamsters-backpack.com/en) and others to be announced;

* learning React, Elixir and Phoenix;

* travelling as much as possible.
