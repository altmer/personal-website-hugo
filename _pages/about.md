## I'm a software developer
---

_Living in Berlin, Germany_

My biggest passion in life is to create great products for real people (and for fun of course).
I started doing programming in university [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) team. My first years
of professional career went in [a large consulting company](http://at-consulting.co.uk/) in Moscow, Russian Federation.
In this company I was doing Java (and later Ruby) development for a number of enterprise-scale projects.
To take a next step of my life and career, I moved to Berlin for its inspirational and creative atmosphere and joined [cool startup](http://finreach.de) in Fintech area.

I like exploring and learning something new. [Travelling](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/members/altmer) is my second passion in life. That's why my biggest side project is a [travel planning app](http://hamster.travel) for me and my friends (and hopefully for other travellers in the future). I am trying to spend some time every day developing side projects to learn, to expand my horizons and to create something cool.

**Ruby on Rails** stays the main technology in my stack for some time. Though I don't actively develop in **Java**
at the moment, I have some experience with it and can create web apps and/or microservices with **Spring**.
My default database of choice is **Postgresql**, but I have also used **MongoDB** and **Redis** in number of projects.
I use **Angular** as a frontend JS framework, in my projects but now I am switching to **React**. Currently I am
Also I have experience with **Elasticsearch** powering search on large dataset (hundreds of millions of records).
Now I am learning myself some **Nodejs** (**Meteor** and **Express** web frameworks) and feel excited about it.

I can freely communicate in **English** or **Russian** (which is my native language) and currently learning **German**.

At the moment I am:

- working at [FinReach](http://finreach.de) making banking services better;
- developing [Hamster Travel](http://hamster.travel) as my side project;
- learning React and backend Javascript development;
- some other projects to be announced soon.
