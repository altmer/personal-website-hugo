## I'm a software developer
---

My biggest passion in life is to create great products for real people (and for fun of course).

I like exploring new things and experiences.

Currently I'm working at [FinReach](http://finreach.de) making banking services better.

What to cover here:

1. Some history - university, enterprise (AT Consulting), startup, side projects
2. Technologies I know and like (Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Angular, Java)
3. Side projects as part of my exploration passion
4. What I strive to learn (from Java to Ruby to Nodejs, React, Meteor, Express)
5. My tools (macbook pro, notepad, rubymine/atom)
6. At the moment I: Finreach, hamster travel, new projects coming soon
