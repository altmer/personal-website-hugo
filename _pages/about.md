## I'm a software developer
---

What to cover here:

1. Some history - university, enterprise (AT Consulting), startup, side projects
2. Technologies I know and like (Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Angular, Java)
3. Side projects as part of my exploration passion
4. What I strive to learn (from Java to Ruby to Nodejs, React, Meteor, Express)
5. At the moment I: Finreach, hamster travel, new projects coming soon
6. My tools (macbook pro, notepad, rubymine/atom)

My biggest passion in life is to create great products for real people (and for fun of course).
I started doing programming

**Ruby on Rails** stays the main technology in my stack for some time. Though I don't actively develop in **Java**
at the moment, I have some experience with it and can create web apps and/or microservices with **Spring**.
My default database of choice is **Postgresql**, but I have also used **MongoDB** and **Redis** in number of projects.
I have experience with **Elasticsearch**

I like exploring new things and experiences.

At the moment I am:

- working at [FinReach](http://finreach.de) making banking services better;
- developing [Hamster Travel](http://hamster.travel) as my side project;
- learning React and Javascript backend development;
- some other projects to be announced soon
