Enthusiastic web developer with experience in enterprise, startups and open source projects. I enjoy solving challenging tasks and creating great products making peoples' life better. Being a fan of reliable and easy-to-change projects, I strive to make the code in my projects as clean and tested as possible. Besides my main work, I develop my side project in which my passions for travel and creation are combined.
